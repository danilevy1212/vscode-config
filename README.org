* VSCODE Config

  This repo contains my setting's for visual-studio-code.

** Installation

   Clone the repository in the location of User settings folder. If you have
   already made modifications to you VSCode settings you may have to delete this
   folder first.

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     git clone https://github.com/danilevy1212/vscode-config.git \
      "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Code[- VERSION]/User"
   #+END_SRC

   The [bracketed] text can vary depending on the installed Visual Studio Code
   version. Lastly, to install all the extensions run the ~install-extensions.sh~
   script. From the User directory run:


   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     ./install-extensions.sh
   #+END_SRC


*** Warning

    As of the time of writing, vs-code does not fully suport the [[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/ar01s03.html][XDG Base
    Directory Specification]], as the user cannot change the directory of the
    ~~/.vscode[- VERSION]/~ folder.

    There is a open [[https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/84808][github issue]] where a solution to this problem is being discussed.
